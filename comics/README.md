# Comic Book Character Analysis
This is a data analysis project focused on exploring comic book characters from two major publishers, Marvel and DC. The data set used in this project contains information about over 16,000 characters from both publishers, including their gender, alignment, identity, and more.

## Project Goals
The primary goal of this project is to explore the data set and gain insights into the characters from these two major comic book publishers. Some of the specific questions we aim to answer include:

- What is the gender diversity of characters in each publisher's universe?
- How have the number and gender of characters evolved over time?
- What are the most common alignments, identities, and living statuses of characters in each universe?
- Who are the top 10 characters with the most appearances in each universe?

## Data
The data for this project is obtained from Kaggle. The data sets include information about various comic book characters, such as their names, publishers, gender, alignment, first appearances, number of appearances, and more.

## Technologies Used
This project was written in R, a popular programming language for data analysis and visualization. The following libraries were used:

- tidyverse for data wrangling and visualization
- plotly for creating interactive plots
- gridExtra for arranging plots on a single page

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following files:

- analysis.Rmd: The main file containing the R code for the data analysis and visualization.
- data/marvel.csv: The data set for Marvel characters.
- data/dc.csv: The data set for DC characters.
- README.md: A brief overview of the project.

## Results
After exploring the data, we found that:

- Marvel has a higher proportion of male characters, while DC has a more balanced gender ratio.
- Both publishers have seen an increase in the number of characters over time, with Marvel's increase being more pronounced.
- The most common alignment for characters in both universes is good, and the most common identity is secret identity.
- The top 10 characters with the most appearances in each universe are dominated by well-known characters such as Spider-Man, Batman, and Superman.

## Conclusion
Through this analysis, we gained a better understanding of the characters from these two major comic book publishers. Further analysis could be done to explore other aspects of the data set, such as relationships between characters and their powers or abilities.
